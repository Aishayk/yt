        <h2>
        <li>She is the youngest of five sisters: Yetunde, Isha, Lyndrea, and Venus. Her eldest sister was murdered in the fall of 2003 in Los Angeles, California. Although she was born in Saginaw, Michigan, she was raised in Los Angeles.</li>
        <li>Her family moved to Palm Beach, Florida when Williams was nine years old so that she could attend Rick Macciâ€™s tennis academy.</li>
        <li>Both Serena together with her elder sister were homeschooled by their father from elementary through high school so that they could spare more time to practice tennis. This move would pay off in the future.</li>
